Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It starts with a row containing only the number 1, and each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers directly above it.

Here's an example of Pascal's triangle with five rows:

   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1



1 4 6 4 1

The numbers in Pascal's triangle have several interesting properties. Each number represents the sum of the two numbers directly above it, and the numbers on the edges of the triangle are always 1. The triangle also exhibits symmetry, as the numbers on both sides are mirror images of each other.

Pascal's triangle has many applications in mathematics, including combinatorics, probability theory, and binomial expansion. It provides a convenient way to calculate binomial coefficients and can be used to solve various mathematical problems.
